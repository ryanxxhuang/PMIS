# P0-07 — Requirement Review and Artifact Link Boundary

## 1. Human review boundary

P0-06 produces traceable AI Requirement suggestions (`draft_ai` /
`needs_review`, linked to a `document_ingestion_run`). P0-07 adds the human
contractual decision on top:

```
AI Requirement Suggestion → Human Review → Approve / Reject
  → Approved Requirement → Authoritative Project Rule
```

Only `status = 'approved'` is authoritative (`is_authoritative` stays a
generated column). The browser cannot manufacture approval: lifecycle
transitions now exist for application users only through the controlled
review action, and every P0-01/P0-03/P0-06 guard remains in force.

## 2. Requirement lifecycle decisions

Three narrow decisions, nothing generic:

| decision | allowed from | result |
|---|---|---|
| `approve` | `draft_ai`, `needs_review` | `approved` |
| `reject` | `draft_ai`, `needs_review` | `rejected` |
| `supersede` | `approved` | `superseded` |

Every other transition is rejected by both the RPC and the transition guard.

## 3. Controlled review RPC

`review_requirement(p_requirement_id uuid, p_decision text)`
(migration `20260710000600_p0_07_requirement_review.sql`), SECURITY DEFINER
with `set search_path = public`, granted to `authenticated` only. It:

1. requires `auth.uid()`; 2. loads the Requirement and derives the project
from the row (the caller can pass no project, reviewer, timestamp, or raw
status); 3. checks `can_review_requirement(project_id)`; 4. validates the
lifecycle transition; 5. for AI-origin Requirements enforces the completed-run
rule (§5); 6. updates status + `reviewed_by = auth.uid()` +
`reviewed_at = now()`; 7. returns the updated row so the UI refreshes from the
server.

The RPC marks the transaction with a transaction-local GUC
(`pmis.requirement_review = <requirement id>`, cleared after the update).
PostgREST clients cannot set arbitrary GUCs, so only this function can open
the door that the snapshot guard checks. There is no service-role review path
for normal users.

## 4. Server-stamped review identity/time

The redefined `requirements_snapshot_guard` (P0-07 block; the P0-03 migration
text is untouched — later blocks override earlier function definitions)
rejects any authenticated change to `reviewed_by` / `reviewed_at` outside the
review context: on unreviewed rows with
`review metadata is stamped by the controlled review action`, on reviewed rows
with the original frozen-snapshot error. A reviewer therefore cannot forge
another user's identity or a fake timestamp through direct PATCH.
`origin` and `legacy_contract_obligation_id` are likewise immutable for
application users (the legacy sync trigger never changes their values, so it
is unaffected).

## 5. Failed ingestion-run approval protection

An AI-origin Requirement may become `approved` only when its linked
`document_ingestion_run` has `status = 'completed'`. A run that is `pending`,
`processing`, `failed` — or missing entirely (`ingestion_run_id is null` on an
`origin='ai'` row) — blocks approval with
`AI requirement approval requires a completed ingestion run`. This is enforced
twice: in the RPC (clear pre-check) and in the transition guard, where it
binds **every** writer including the service role. Rejecting a failed-run
suggestion stays allowed. `manual` / `migration` Requirements never need a
run.

## 6. Requirement review UI

New dedicated page `/requirements` (nav 履約需求), separate from the legacy
deadline list; the Contract-page ingestion card links to it (查看履約需求)
after a successful extraction. The page uses bounded, focused Supabase queries
(runs ≤ 100, requirements ≤ 300, sources for the listed rows only; detail
links load per selection) — nothing enters the global store. Filters: scope
(current / all history), status, requirement type, responsible party,
source-verification state, ingestion run. Default queue = manual/migration
Requirements plus AI suggestions from the **latest completed** run per
document version; failed/processing/pending run suggestions never appear by
default but stay inspectable through the explicit run filter (nothing is
deleted). Ordering is deterministic: `needs_review` → `draft_ai` → reviewed
states, oldest first, id as tiebreak (`src/lib/requirementReview.js`).

Review controls (核定 / 駁回 / 廢止取代) render only for
`can.reviewRequirement`, call the RPC, and update state exclusively from the
server response — no optimistic approval. Reviewers may also correct
suggestion content (title, description, type, responsibility, phase,
acceptance criteria, evidence) while the row is `draft_ai`/`needs_review`;
the DB confines such edits to unreviewed rows.

## 7. Source presentation

Every `requirement_sources` row is shown with document title, version label,
page (`第 N 頁` only when a grounded page number exists; otherwise
`無可靠頁碼` — a DOCX storage segment index is never displayed as a page),
section, clause, and the exact quotation. Verification state is always
visible with neutral labels — 來源已核對 / 來源待人工確認 — and unverified
sources are never hidden; they are reviewable by an authorized human with the
limitation made obvious. AI provenance (run, document, version, model, prompt
version, completion time) is shown with an explicit note that provenance is
traceability, not authority.

## 8. Citation mutation safety

`guard_requirement_source_verification` (BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE on
`requirement_sources`, authenticated writers only):

* INSERT with `source_verified = true` → rejected
  (`source verification is determined by the system`).
* UPDATE changing any citation field (`document_version_id`, `page_number`,
  `page_label`, `section`, `clause`, `source_text`, offsets) → the verdict is
  conservatively reset to `false`, even if the writer claims `true`.
* UPDATE flipping `false → true` without a citation change → rejected.

No LLM re-verification is performed. The P0-06 ingestion service (no
authenticated JWT) is exempt and keeps writing deterministic verified
sources. The P0-03 snapshot guard fires first (alphabetical trigger order),
so citations of reviewed Requirements stay frozen with their original error.

## 9. BOQ candidate link review

`requirement_work_items.review_status` (`suggested` / `approved` /
`rejected`) is the canonical decision state. The legacy `reviewed` boolean is
retained as a **derived** compatibility field — a sync trigger enforces
`reviewed = (review_status = 'approved')` on every write, and a writer that
only sets the boolean is folded into the equivalent `review_status`, so the
two can never drift. Existing rows were migrated (`false → suggested`,
`true → approved`). An application user cannot insert an AI link that is
already approved (`AI work-item suggestions must start as suggested`); the
P0-06 service inserts stay `suggested`. Reviewers (RLS:
`can_review_requirement`) approve/reject suggestions or manually add links —
manual links reference a real `work_items.id` resolved from the BOQ by exact
item number (never fuzzy titles), and the P0-01 same-project trigger applies
to every link.

## 10–11. Approved Requirement artifact boundary — `requirement_artifact_links`

```
requirement_artifact_links (
  id, requirement_id → requirements, artifact_type, artifact_id,
  generation_type (manual | ai_draft | migration),
  created_by (server-stamped for authenticated writers), created_at,
  unique (requirement_id, artifact_type, artifact_id))
```

DB-enforced invariants (`validate_requirement_artifact_link`):

* the Requirement must be `approved` — `draft_ai`, `needs_review`, `rejected`
  (and cascaded missing rows) cannot create links;
* the polymorphic target must exist and belong to the same project. Explicit
  per-type mapping to real durable tables only: `inspection_point →
  inspection_points`, `checklist → checklist_templates`, `test →
  test_samples`, `submittal → submittals`, `evidence → photos`, `deadline →
  contract_obligations` (compatibility). `report` has no durable target table
  yet and is deliberately outside the initial CHECK vocabulary — no fake FK
  target was invented.

RLS: project members read; creation/deletion requires
`can_review_requirement`; no UPDATE policy (a link is a point-in-time
decision — delete and recreate). The UI shows 已連結流程項目 (or the neutral
尚未建立流程項目) in the approved-Requirement detail; P0-07 ships no link
creation wizard and no generators.

## 12. No automatic active workflow generation

P0-07 never turns AI output into an active H hold point, a submitted
inspection, or an approved checklist. The protected chain is: AI suggestion →
human-approved Requirement → (future) draft artifact generation → authorized
domain workflow. Generators belong to later chapters.

## 13. Authorization

* Requirement lifecycle + BOQ link decisions + artifact-link creation:
  `can_review_requirement(project)` (agency PM/engineer, supervisor
  manager/engineer) — per project, fail-closed.
* `is_project_admin` and `profiles.org_type` grant nothing here (verified by
  pgTAP: a contractor PM with technical-admin status cannot review, and the
  same user has different review authority on different projects).
* Contractors/document managers who ingest documents get no linking or review
  authority from that fact.

## 14. Deliberate non-goals

No P0-08 document review cycles, P0-09 onboarding, P0-10 intelligence layer,
AI copilot, ITP/checklist/test generators, or automatic workflow activation.
No artifact-creation wizard, no `report` artifact target, no LLM
re-verification of edited citations, no demo-mode seed data for the review
page (demo shows an explanatory empty state), and no changes to the P0-06
Edge Function — service-role ingestion writes are exercised unchanged by the
P0-07 pgTAP suite.
